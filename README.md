# Scrivener Names

This is a collection of name lists for use with the Scrivener Name Generator. The lists are all in the same format, so you can mix and match them. I’ve included a few lists of my own, and a few from other sources. I’ve also included a few lists of last names, which are not included in the Scrivener Name Generator.

## US Names - Nineteenth Century

These come from multiple sources. Civil War names are based on generals who fought both sides in the war. 1812 names are based on muster lists from Illinois and Alabama. The 1850s list includes a sampling from the 1850 US Census. Only the 1850 lists include female names.

## US First Names By Decade

Assembled from Social Security Administration records, these files each 1000 names, representing the most popular first names in the United States for the year, showed. Remember these are birth years, so a 50-year-old character in a book set in the 1970s should draw from the 1920 list. These lists are all sorted in order of popularity, so should be compatible with the Name Generator obscurity slider.

## US Census Last Names

These lists come from the archives of the 2000 US Census, and feature the 1000 most popular last names for Asians and Latinos living in the United States, and a massive list of every surname used by at least 0.001% of the United States. None are curated, so Smith is on both lists, as there are enough Americans of both Latino and Asian origins for that name to show up in the top 1000. The US Census list contains nearly 19,000 names.

## Old English Names

Taken from lists of British names dating back to the 1200s, these provide a nice sample of English names in the 1200s, 1300s, and 1600s. The 1200s First Names list is the most extensive, coming from the Fine Rolls of Henry III, a fantastic cross sampling of first names from the era. May have a high fantasy feel to them.

## 1872 German Names

They took these names from a list of emigrants leaving Germany that year. Which means they lived there. Right? Which means it’s a cross sampling of names used in German in the mid-19th century. Sadly, while the list includes first and last names, the first names aren’t gendered. So there’s only a last name list.

## Historical Russian

 Russian first names from the 13th to 15th centuries. This list is actually larger than the combined US first name list above. It will take a few minutes to import. As with the English lists, these feel fantastic for fantasy. |mac-formatted-name-files
