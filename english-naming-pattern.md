## Naming Pattern

The most common convention was for the parents to choose names that honored people. Sometimes the people so honored were powerful people, such as a local, wealthy landowner. Sometimes the names honored royalty. So there were many Henrys named after King Henry and many Georges named after King George. The most common persons to honor, however, were the gender appropriate grandparents and parents. There was even a convention in the order in which the ancestors were honored – probably to avoid insulting anyone. Although it was far from universally used, the usual British naming convention was as follows:

* The first son was named after the paternal grandfather
* The second son was named after the maternal grandfather
* The third son was named after the father
* The fourth son was named after the oldest paternal uncle
* The fifth was named after the second oldest paternal uncle or the oldest maternal uncle

* The first daughter was named after the maternal grandmother
* The second daughter was named after the paternal grandmother
* The third daughter was named after the mother
* The fourth daughter was named after the oldest maternal aunt
* The fifth was named after the second oldest maternal aunt or the oldest paternal aunt

## Given Names

When they were christened, children usually received one or two given names. Some were named after parents or other relatives.

Family researchers might run across Biblical names, such as Zacharias or Benjamin, or names for religious principles, like Faith, Hope, and Charity. Such names were not common in England and may suggest that the family was particularly committed to religion and may have been non-conformist dissenters (belonged to a church other than the state Church of England, or Anglican). This can be a significant hint to the family researcher.

Since many children died in the 17th and 18th centuries, parents had no problem with re-using the name of a dead child for a subsequent birth. A family might, therefore, have several John or Jane children. Occasionally, the same name was given to more than one living child, but this was rare. The re-use of a name almost always meant that the first named child has died.

In working class families pre-1900, the use of a surname as a second given name almost always indicates illegitimacy. It was a convenient way to indicate the child’s parentage by giving the father’s surname as a middle name to a child who would bear its mother’s surname.

## Surnames Historical Development

Before record keeping began, most people had only one name, such as John.

As the population increased, it became necessary to distinguish between individuals with the same name. The problem was usually solved by adding descriptive information. John became John the smith, John the son of Matthew, John the short, or John from Leeds.

At first surnames applied only to one person, not to the whole family. After a few generations, these names became hereditary and were passed on from generation to generation.

Surnames developed from several sources. For example:

* Occupational (based on a person’s trade, such as Carter or Smith)
* Geographical (based on a person’s residence, such as Drayton or Debenham)
* Patronymic (based on a person’s father’s name, such as Jones, son of John)
* Descriptive or nickname (such as Joy or Child)

The nobility and wealthy land owners were the first to begin using surnames.

Merchants and townspeople then adopted the custom, as did the rural population. This process took two or three centuries.
